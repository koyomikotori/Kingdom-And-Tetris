## Experience rules for squads and generals (GDD §8, M11e).
## Squads: 3 levels by XP per soldier, from battles and barracks training (training stops at
## Veteran); new soldiers join with 0 XP and dilute the squad's average (Army.add_soldiers).
## Generals: only the commander who led a battle gains XP; each level gives 1 point the player
## adds to Võ lực or Thống suất (Generals.spend_point).
